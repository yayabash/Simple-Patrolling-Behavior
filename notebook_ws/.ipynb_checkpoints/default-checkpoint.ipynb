    "The patrolling behavior is a behavior that makes the robot **continuously move around an environment while avoiding the obstacles**.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Create a ROS2 package named `patrol_behavior`**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * This package is the one that will contain the full project\n",
    "    * Inside the package include a ROS Python file named `patrol.py`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Subscribe to the laser topic of the robot**\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Inside the `patrol.py`, you need to subscribe to the laser topic and capture the rays \n",
    "    * In the callback of the subscriber, store the values of the ray on the right (the one that makes a 90ยบ angle to the right with the front of the robot), the left annd the front and use them to know the robot's distance to the obstacles\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "3. **Publish to the velocity topic of the robot**\n",
    "    \n",
    "    * Also inside the `patrol.py`, create a publisher to the `/cmd_vel` topic that controls the wheels\n",
    "    * At every step of the control loop, you need to publish the proper velocity command on that topic, based on the value of the distances detected by the laser.\n",
    "    * An example logic would be the following:\n",
    "        * If the distance to the wall (or any other obstacle) is **smaller than 0.15m in either side (right or left) of the robot**, you need to make the robot rotate to the opposite direction in order to move away from the wall\n",
    "        * If the distance to the wall (or any other obstacle) is **smaller than 0.35m in front of the robot**, you need to rotate the robot to the direction (right or left) which is more clear of obstacles\n",
    "        * If the distance to the wall (or any other obstacle) is **bigger than the distance thresholds**, just keep the robot moving forward\n",
    "    \n",
    "    **IMPORTANT**\n",
    "\n",
    "    Note that this is just an example logic, but it is not the only one, so you can freely create your own. The result of this whole behavior must be that the robot moves along the whole environment while avoiding the obstacles in it (see video below).\n",
